                    The love and interest to share the beauty of natural gemstones and tastefully crafted jewellery
                    served as an inspiration to launch Mangata & Gallo in 2023 by Patrick T. With passion and
                    determination,
                    he earned his Applied Jewelry Professional™ diploma from the Gemological Institute of the Universe
                    (GIU).
                    <br><br>
                    Mangata & Gallo started featuring curated gemstone jewellery from the gem-cutting capitals of Asia,
                    then
                    soon began developing its own signature jewellery pieces through collaboration with highly skilled
                    Filipino jewellery artisans.
                    <br><br>
                    Each jewellery piece is presented with pride with each fascinating gemstone highlighted in a
                    thoughtful setting from the captivating classic pieces to signature contemporary designs.

                <p>
                    Each piece in our assortment starts with our in-house design team. We're inspired by sleek, modern
                    sculptural designs and patterns; we celebrate the pop of a gemstone, the subtle sparkle of a
                    diamond; and we're energized by your personal style. Each design goes through countless versions in
                    partnership with our master jewelers to perfect settings, lengths, chain links, clasps, ring
                    comfort, earring fit—no detail goes unnoticed or undiscussed—until the piece is exactly right.
                    <br><br>
                    Our expert jewelers then use the highest quality materials from precious metals—from recycled gold
                    and 18k gold vermeil, to responsibly sourced diamonds and AAA-grade gemstones. Our jewelers span the
                    globe, our sterling silver and gemstone experts, for example, are in Seoul, South Korea, and the
                    craftsmen behind many of our gold chains in Arezzo, Italy.
